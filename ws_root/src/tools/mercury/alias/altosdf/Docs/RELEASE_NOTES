********* External Release Notes *************

version 1.0 a3 - 2/29/96 

* Lighting information is written out to ASCII SDF file.

* Unified the command line interface across all conversion tools. 

* Separate materials and textures in different files.

version 1.0 a2 

*	Object types not supported
	1. Camera
	2. Light
	3. Key frame animation data

*	Texture tiling information is not exported yet. Default
	is assumed to be "clamping"
	
*	.utf texture files
	The converter does not output the utf files automatically. 
	You need to use texture conversion  utilities to convert 
	Alias PIX images to .utf files.
	
*	Textures, materials and models are shared where ever possible
			
*	Tiled textures needs be to powers-of-two in the direction of tiling

*	Alias by default uses double-sided rendering but the converter
	uses the direction of the normals for the polygons. You will see
	some of the geometry inverted on M2 because of this. To avoid
	the problem turn-off the double-sidedness in Alias and then
	flip the geometry to make it look right.

*	Procedural textures in Alias does not have a file associated with
	them so the converter creates a dummy file reference using 
	texture object name. You need to generate a .utf file corresponding 
	to this procedural texture.
	
*	All of the models and hierarchies from the file are enclosed
	in a top-level node named as "filename_world". If the prefix
	is requested then it will be "prefix_world". This convention is
	used to generate unique names for each file
