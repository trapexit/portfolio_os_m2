Alias to SDF converter 
---------------------

This program converts Alias "wire format" to M2 "SDF format". 
The data that is supported at this point is geometry 
(NURBS, polygons etc.), hierarchy, materials and  textures.

The converter can generate triangles or quadrilaterals. You 
can also control polygon count by specifying tessellation 
quality ( coarse or fine ). 

Texture references are the file names from Alias package. You
need to convert Alias "Pix" files to "M2 .utf" format. Currently 
references to procedural textures are written out as "texture_name.utf"
you need to generate a ".utf" corresponding to these textures.
  

Entities it can Read :

1.	Objects ( Geometry and other )
	. Polygon set object
	. NURBS ( non-uniform rational b-spline surface )
	. Trimmed surface
	. Face
	. Geometry vertex has POSITION, TEXTURE COORDINATES 
	  and NORMALS information.
	. Transformation matrices
	. Object name

2.	Textures
	Texture vertices data for individual objects
	Texture map name
	
3.	Material
	. Ambient
	. Emission
	. Specular
	. Shininess
	. Transparency
	. Material name

4.	Hierarchy
	. Groups
	. Relative transformation matrices
	. Hierarchy node names

5.	Data sharing information
	Converter also writes out necessary sharing information
	for models, hierarchies, material and textures.

6.	Lights


Usage: altosdf [-r] [-l] [-m] [-t polytype] [-p prefix] [-q tessquality] [-sa scriptfile] [-sn scriptfile] [-o outfile] <infile>
  This program creates a SDF data out of a wire file
  -r               do not write texture references[ default write textures ]
  -l               do not write lighting information [default = ON]
  -m               separate materials and textures in different files [default = OFF]
  -t polytype      quads for quadrilateral polygons [ default triangles ]
  -p prefix        concatenate the 'prefix' to object names[ default none ]
  -q tessquality   0.0 to 1.0 for coarse to fine quality [ default 0.5 ]
  -sa scriptfile   append to a texture conversion script file [ default none ]
  -sn scriptfile   output to a texture conversion script file [ default none ]
  -o outfile       output SDF file name[ default stdout ]
  infile           input Alias wire file name

  eg : altosdf car -p car_ -t quads -q 0.7 -s car.scr -o car.sdf

the script file contains commands in the form of :

  process_procedural_tex Ramp_4 Ramp_4.utf
  process_image_tex /usr/astro/3DO/Allmaps/mp_redritetop mp_redritetop.utf

  The first argument is the either Alias texture name ( procedure where there 
  is no file associated ) or Alias file name ( associated PIX file ). The 
  second argument is the SDF texture file name ( this is the file referenced 
  in the SDF file ). This script file can be used to batch process Alias 
  textures to .utf textures.
