    2. -h option is added. It will create a header file which define the sdf object name and its id.
    3. -s option is added. A sdf "triangle" primitive will be interpreted as a faceted surface in pod geometry.


* New pod geometry cases:
	1. DynLitEnvCase.
	2. DynLitTransEnvCase.
	3. DynLitSpecEnvCase.
	4. PreLitEnvCase.
	5. PreLitTransEnvCase.

* Faced surface is supported. A sdf triangle primitive will be interpreted as a faceted surface.

* object instancing bug is fixed.

5/15/96 version 1.0a2

* The tool usage updates.
    1. -s option is removed. The snake option is applied to every pod.
    2. -c options is added. It will collapse the leaf animation node.
	3. -a option is added to output a separate animation file. All of the 
	   animation data is in the animation file. If the option is not specidied,
	   the animation file will be part of the geometry file.

* The tool outputs the following pod geometry cases:                     
	1. DynLitCase.
	2. DynLitTexCase.
	3. DynLitTransCase.
	4. DynLitTransTexCase.
	5. DynLitSpecCase.
	6. DynLitSpecTexCase.
	7. DynLitTransSpecCase.
	8. PreLitCase.
	9. PreLitTexCase.
	10. PreLitTransCase.

4/19/96 version 1.0a1

* The tool runs on both Mac (MPW) and SGI. The MPW tool is a fat version.
* The lighting information is not processed in the current tool. One should 
remove the lighting information in the sdf file. Please refer to each 
converter's usage and do not output lighting information. Or one can delete 
lighting information by editing the sdf file.
* The Mac version will crash on Quadra 700.

12/1/96 version 3.1b1
* Several memory leaks have been fixed.
* Crashes that occured when compiling an SDF file with lighting information have been fixed.
* Multiple model references within an animation are now handled correctly.
