>>>How do sales of the other versions of PO'ed compare to the
3DO sales. Not exact figures, but just a rough comparison.
Interested to see if it did as well on the PSX considering
there is more competition for good 3D first person shooters
on that system than on the 3DO.<<<

Believe it or not, they were almost identical.  However, given that the
PSX user base is much bigger than 3DO's, I'd say that the 3DO version did
better.
