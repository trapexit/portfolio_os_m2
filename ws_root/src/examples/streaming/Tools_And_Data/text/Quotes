    Five senses; an incurably abstract intellect; a haphazardly selective memory; a set of preconceptions and assumptions so numerous that I can never examine more than a minority of them--never become even conscious of them all. How much of total reality can such an apparatus let through?
    -- C. S. Lewis

        "The ultimate metric that I would like to propose for user friendliness is quite simple: if this system were a person, how long would it take before you punched it in the nose?"
                                                -- Tom Carey

"The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on
life.  Attitude, to me, is more important than facts.  It is more 
important than the past, than education, than money, than circum-
stances, than failures, than successes, than what other people
think or say or do.  It is more important than appearance, gift-
edness, or skill.  It will make or break a company...a church...
a home.  The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday
regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day.  We cannot
change our past...we cannot change the inevitable.  The only 
thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is
our attitude...I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to
me and 90% how I react to it.  And so it is with you...we are
in charge of our Attitudes."
                         -Charles Swindoll
