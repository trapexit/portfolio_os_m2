THIS README FILE COVERS THE FOLLOWING TOPICS:

	¥ THE DATA STREAMING EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS
	¥ CREATING STREAMED OUTPUTS


RUNNING DATA STREAMING EXAMPLES
---------------------------------

Data Streaming examples included in the Streaming Folder
under Examples folder are:

	¥ PlaySA
		This is an example of using high level stream playback
		routines for AIFF and MPEG audio. See the Autodocs for
		usage info.

	¥ VideoPlayer
		This is an example of playback of MPEG Video with or
		without audio. See the Autodocs for usage info, or run
		"VideoPlayer -?".

	¥ EZFlixPlayer
		This is an example of playback of EZFlix Video.
		See the Autodocs for usage info.

	¥ DataPlayer
		This is an example of playback of pure data.
		See the Autodocs for usage info.
		

CREATING STREAMED OUTPUT
-------------------------- 

'Tools and Data' folder (under :Examples:Streaming: folder) contains
scripts and data for producing streamed output for the aforementioned
examples. Scripts included in this folders are:


	¥ bach_44K_16B_M.script
		This script produces bach_m.stream. 

	¥ mono_sqs2.script
		This script produces mono_sqs2.stream. 

	¥ bob.script
		This script produces bob.stream (MPEG audio only). 

	¥ Video.Worksheet
		This script produces several streams played by VideoPlayer. 

	¥ DATA.Worksheet
		This script produces a stream played by DataPlayer. 

Data included in this folder are:

	¥ bach_44K_16B_M.aiff
		This 16 bit mono, 44KHz raw audio file produces bach_m.stream
		output when used in conjunction with bach_44K_16B_M.script.
		To produce the output, follow the instruction described in
		this file.

	¥ mono.aiff
		44.1 kHz; 16 bits/sample; mono; AIFF.

	¥ raggae.aiff
		44.1 kHz; 16 bits/sample; stereo; AIFF.
		Edited to match length of SF.mpv.
	
	¥ SF.mpv
		MPEG-Video elementary stream; 29.97 frames/sec; 1.6 Mbits/sec.
	
	¥ bob.mpa
		MPEG-Audio elementary stream.
	
	¥ bob.mpv
		MPEG-Video elementary stream; 29.97 frames/sec; 1.2 Mbits/sec.

	¥ BladeForceEZFlix.stream
		An example of weaved EZFlix video and AIFF audio.
		
	¥ BladeForceMPEG.stream
		An example of weaved MPEG video and AIFF audio.

	¥ SF.stream
		An example of weaved MPEG video and AIFF audio.

	¥ stopgoto.stream
		An example of weaved MPEG video and AIFF audio with
		markers points & stop chunks.

	¥ bob_av.stream
		An example of weaved MPEG audio and video.

	¥ Quotes
		Pre-compressed data used by DataPlayer.
