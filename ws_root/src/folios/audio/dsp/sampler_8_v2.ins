\\\
\\\	  Description
\\\
\\\	    Variable-rate stereophonic 8-bit sample player.
\\\
\\\	    This instrument is limited to a pitch one octave above base pitch, if
\\\	    recorded at 44.1 kHz. If it is recorded at 22 kHz, the pitch can go two
\\\	    octaves up.
\\\
\\\	  Knobs
\\\
\\\	    SampleRate - AUDIO_SIGNAL_TYPE_SAMPLE_RATE
\\\	        SampleRate in Hertz. Range is 0.0 to 88200.0. Default is 44100.0.
\\\
\\\	    Amplitude - AUDIO_SIGNAL_TYPE_GENERIC_SIGNED
\\\	        -1.0 to 1.0, defaults to 1.0.
\\\
\\\	  Outputs
\\\
\\\	    Output - 2 parts
\\\	        Stereo output.

\\\
\\\	  Caveats
\\\
\\\	    8-bit audio sounds inherently BAD because there is very little information
\\\	    in each sample. Use one of the compressed data formats such as SQS2 for mono
\\\	    samples, or CBD2 for stereo samples, for better quality. The only reason to
\\\	    use 8-bit audio is if you don't have the 16-bit original recording.
