 Version 0.3 September 1, 1992
 	Changes from last version
		Added conditional includes to define data types
		which are defined in the Opera environment but
		not in the MAC environment.  This file should now
		be able to be included in either environment.
		Changes the SPITEHDR to contain an exact copy
		of an Opera SCOB data structure.
 Version 0.2
	Changes from last version:
		Added a sprite Header chunk as suggested by slandrum
		Incorporated slandrum's suggested changes to CLUTLISTS
		Changed some fields in image header from uint16 to Int32
		
This document proposes a straw man image file format for
the Opera Hardware.  This format is designed to
	1) Provide an efficient native file format for
		images and sprites on the opera target
	2) Provide an archieval format for image storage 
		and image processing on development platforms.
	3) Be as simple as possible.
		
The idea is to have a common format which is capable of storing
24 bit images, perhaps with associated copyright notice, for storage
on a development station server machine.  This image will then be
processed into a background or sprite image and placed on a CD ROM 
for use by a product.  This format should be capable of encoding
both of these types of images.

Overview

This is a very simple tagged format.  A file is composed of one or more
chunks.  Each chunk contains a chunk_ID, a chunk_size and the data for the
chunk.  Chunks are not nested.  Chunks are concatenated together in a file.
The only required chunks for an image are a header chunk (image header or 
sprite header) and the pixel data. A header chunk should be the first chunk
in the file.  Other than this there should be no restrictions on chunk order. 
Also if multiple images are of the same type and same size they can be stored
in the same file by having one header chunk and multiple pixel data chunks.

A file should not contain more than one header chunk.

*/

Preliminaries:
	This file format assumes a "big-endian" architecture,
	that is multi-byte values have their most significant
	bytes stored at the lowest memory addresses.  This is
	the standard memory organization for the 68000 and is
	used in the ARM6 on the opera machine.
	
	
	
	{file}  		::=	{chunk} | {file}{chunk}
	{chunk_header}	::=	{chunk_ID} {chunk_size}
	{chunk} 		::=	{chunk_header}{chunk body}
	
	{chunk_ID} 		::= 'IMAG'	|			/* Image header  */
						'SPRH'	|			/* Sprite header */
						'PDAT'	|			/* Pixel Data	 */
						'PIPT'	|			/* PIP Table     */
						'CLUT'	|			/* CLUT list     */
						'MCLT'	|			/* Multiple Line CLUT List */
						'CPYR'	|			/* Copyright Notice */
						'DESC'	|			/* Text Description of image */
						'KWRD'	|			/* Text Keywords associated with image */
						'CRDT'				/* Text credits associated with image */
						
	{chunk_size}::= Unsigned 32 bit integer (includes size of chunk body plus size
					of the chunk header).  Chunk_size is 8 plus size of the chunk_body.
					Chunks must be Quad byte alligned.  Chunks will be padded with
					zeros to fill up the quad word alignment.
/*

ISSUES:
	Should the chunk_size include the 8 bytes needed for the Chunk ID and the chunk size?
	If we don't include these 8 bytes then just after you have read the size you can
	skip that many bytes and find the next Chunk_ID  (or the EOF).
	Alignment:  I suspect we will be better off by making all chunks 4 byte aligned.
	The Arm processor is much better at loading 32 bit quantities from quad word addresses.
	Since not all chunks will be a multiple of 4 bytes in lenght we are forced to put the actual
	chunk length in the chunk_size field and then round up to find the next chunk boundary.

The QUADALIGN macro can be useful in dealing with chunk sizes
*/


/*
ISSUE:

Should fields that require 16 bits such as width and height be stored as 16 or
32 bit fields in the files structure?  The Arm Processor provides more efficient
access to 32 bit fields, but the 16 bit fields save space.  To access 16 bit fields
the Arm processor actually performs two byte access and then shifts and adds to 
assemble the 16 bit value.
