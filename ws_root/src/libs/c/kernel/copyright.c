 *  I just realized how I can make the copyright symbol appear in the
 *  text file without blowing our source code control system out of the water;
 *  but there is a risk that viewers not using ISO-compliant display fonts will
 *  not see the symbol as a copyright symbol. With this in mind, should the
 *  message in the distributed code contain \251 or (C)?

 *
 *  Greg,
 *  It is commonly accepted procedure to use (c) in cases where the \251 is not
 *  practical to use.  In this case, it may be safer to use the (c) designation
 *  rather than the \251 designation to ensure that those who receive the copyright
 *  notice electronically but do not have the proper font display capability will
 *  still be able to understand the implications behind the copyright notice.
