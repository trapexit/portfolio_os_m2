 /**
 |||	AUTODOC -public -class libmusic -group SoundPlayer -name spCreatePlayer
 |||	Create an SPPlayer.
 |||
 |||	  Synopsis
 |||
 |||	    Err spCreatePlayer (SPPlayer **resultPlayer,
 |||	                        Item samplerInstrument,
 |||	                        uint32 numBuffers, uint32 bufferSize,
 |||	                        void * const customBuffers[])
 |||
 |||	  Description
 |||
 |||	    Creates an SPPlayer (the top-level player context). The player needs:
 |||
 |||	    - a sample player DSP instrument to play the sound.
 |||
 |||	    - a set of identically-sized audio buffers used to spool sound off of disc.
 |||
 |||	    The client must supply the sample player instrument. Buffers can be
 |||	    allocated automatically or supplied by the client.
 |||
 |||	    At least 2 buffers are required in order to permit smooth sound
 |||	    playback. Since each buffer will have a signal allocated for it, there
 |||	    can be no more than 23 buffers (the number of free signals for a task
 |||	    that has no signals allocated). 4 or 5 is probably a comfortable
 |||	    number of buffers.
 |||
 |||	    Buffer size must be at least 512 bytes for in-memory sounds or 2 *
 |||	    blocksize + 512 for sounds off disc. Typically much larger buffers are
 |||	    required to smoothly playback sounds directly off disk (e.g. 16K or
 |||	    so for 44100 frame/sec playback of a 16-bit monophonic sound).
 |||
 |||	    For disc-based sounds, the buffer size, truncated to a multiple of
 |||	    block size, represents the maximum amount of data that can be read
 |||	    from the disc in a single I/O request. Given the nature of data being
 |||	    read from a CD, the larger the buffer, the more efficiently the player
 |||	    will read data off of disc. In order to guarantee smooth sound
 |||	    playback, there must be enough data spooled at all times to cover the
 |||	    read of 1 buffer. Obviously, this requires that the data can be read
 |||	    faster than it can be played.
 |||
 |||	    The total size of all of the buffers represents the maximum latency
 |||	    between reading and the actual sound output (the responsiveness to
 |||	    branches and decisions). The maximum latency can be computed as
 |||	    follows:
 |||
 |||	    max latency (sec) = numBuffers * bufferSize / frame size / sample rate
 |||
 |||	    For example:
 |||	        numBuffers = 4
 |||
 |||	        bufferSize = 16384 bytes
 |||
 |||	        frame size = 2 (16-bit monophonic)
 |||
 |||	        sample rate = 44100 frames / sec
 |||
 |||	        max latency = 4 * 16384 / 2 / 44100 = 0.743 sec
 |||
 |||	    With the above buffer configuration and playback rate, the results of
 |||	    branches and decision functions will be heard no later than about 3/4
 |||	    second afterwards.
 |||
 |||	    The client is left with the problem of striking a good balance between
 |||	    efficient I/O usage and responsiveness for any specific application.
 |||
 |||	    Use spDeletePlayer() to dispose of this SPPlayer when you are done
 |||	    with it.
 |||
 |||	  Arguments
 |||
 |||	    resultPlayer
 |||	        Pointer to buffer to write resulting
 |||	        SPPlayer pointer. Must be supplied or
 |||	        or else this function returns ML_ERR_BADPTR.
 |||
 |||	    samplerInstrument
 |||	        Item number of sample player instrument to be used to play back sounds
 |||	        with this SPPlayer. You may use any instrument, including a patch, as
 |||	        long as it has exactly one input FIFO and no output FIFOs. All sounds
 |||	        added to the player must be of a format that this sampler instrument
 |||	        can play. The player has no way to verify correctness of instrument,
 |||	        however. You are responsible for all connections to this instrument
 |||	        (e.g., connecting to line_out.dsp(@) in order to hear the output).
 |||
 |||	    numBuffers
 |||	        Number of buffers to use. Valid range is
 |||	        2..23 (limited by available signals).
 |||
 |||	    bufferSize
 |||	        Size of each buffer in bytes. For in-memory
 |||	        sounds, must be at least 512 bytes. For
 |||	        sounds to spool directly off disc, must be
 |||	        at least 2*blocksize+512. In practice larger
 |||	        buffers for disc-based sounds are probably
 |||	        required in order to provide smooth sound
 |||	        playback.
 |||
 |||	    customBuffers
 |||	        Table of pointers to client-supplied buffers. If NULL is passed in for
 |||	        this argument, the player will allocate memory for the specified buffers.
 |||
 |||	        Use this if you want to allocate your own buffers instead of letting the
 |||	        player do it. The table must contain numBuffers pointers to unique
 |||	        buffers that must be bufferSize in length. All buffer pointers must be
 |||	        even-byte-aligned addresses.
 |||
 |||	        The customBuffers table (if there is one) is copied into the SPPlayer
 |||	        structure, so the table need not remain valid after this function
 |||	        returns.
 |||
 |||	  Return Value
 |||
 |||	    Non-negative value on success; negative error code on failure.
 |||
 |||	  Outputs
 |||
 |||	    A pointer to an allocated SPPlayer is written to the buffer
 |||	    pointed to by resultPlayer on success. NULL is written to this
 |||	    buffer on failure.
 |||
 |||	  Caveats
 |||
 |||	    Because spService() and spStartReading() wait for file I/O to complete, it is
 |||	    recommended that you use a separate, dedicated thread for each SPPlayer.
 |||
 |||	    An SPPlayer and its related structures must be operated on only by the task
 |||	    or thread which created the SPPlayer. This is because an SPPlayer has a
 |||	    set of task signals associated with it belonging to the task which created
 |||	    the SPPlayer, and the sound player structures have no semaphores to
 |||	    arbitrate shared access to them.
 |||
 |||	    This function allocates one signal from the calling task or thread for each
 |||	    buffer. Keep this in mind when deciding how many buffers to use.
 |||
 |||	    The sound player will not work correctly unless the sample frame
 |||	    size for the sample follows these rules:
 |||
 |||	    - If frame size < 1 byte, then frames must not span byte boundaries.
 |||	    There must be an integral number of frames per byte.
 |||
 |||	    - If frame size >= 1, then all frame boundaries must fall on byte
 |||	    boundaries. There must be an integral number of bytes per frame.

 |||
 |||	  Arguments
 |||
 |||	    player
 |||	        SPPlayer to which to install default decision function.
 |||
 |||	    decisionFunc
 |||	        An SPDecisionFunction(@) to install, or NULL to clear.

 |||	    decisionData
 |||	        A pointer to client-supplied data to be

 |||
 |||	  Return Value
 |||
 |||	    Non-negative value on success; negative error code on failure.
 |||
 |||	  Notes
 |||
 |||	    The player normally optimizes reading data from disc by
 |||	    ignoring markers that have neither a branch destination nor a marker
 |||	    decision function. When a default decision function is installed, the
 |||	    player must interrupt reading data from disc in preperation for a
 |||	    potential branch at EVERY marker, even if the default decision
 |||	    function does nothing. This can severely impact
 |||	    performance depending on the placement of markers.

 |||	Manually remove an SPSound from an SPPlayer.
 |||
 |||	  Synopsis
 |||
 |||	    Err spRemoveSound (SPSound *sound)
 |||
 |||	  Description
 |||
 |||	    Removes and frees the specified sound from the SPPlayer that it
 |||	    belongs to. All markers belonging to this sound including any
 |||	    the client may have added, are automatically freed by this function.
 |||
 |||	    All sounds belonging to an SPPlayer are
 |||	    automatically disposed of when that SPPlayer is disposed of with
 |||	    spDeletePlayer(). Use this function if you want to remove a sound
 |||	    manually.
 |||
 |||	    For sound file class SPSounds, the file opened by spAddSoundFile()
 |||	    is closed. The sample item passed into spAddSample() is left behind
 |||	    after this spRemoveSound() for the client to clean up.
 |||
 |||	    An SPSound cannot be removed from its owning SPPlayer while it is being
 |||	    read from while the player is running. spIsSoundInUse() can be used to
 |||	    determine if the sound is being read. If this function is called for an
 |||	    SPSound for which spIsSoundInUse() returns TRUE, the SPPlayer is
 |||	    stopped by calling spStop().
 |||
 |||	  Arguments
 |||
 |||	    sound
 |||	        Pointer to an SPSound to remove. Can be NULL.
 |||
 |||	  Return Value
 |||
 |||	    Non-negative value on success; negative error code on failure.
 |||
 |||	  Caveats
 |||
 |||	    This function only stops
 |||	    the SPPlayer when while the SPPlayer is still reading from the SPSound
 |||	    being removed, which is fine for AIFF Sound File class SPSounds.
 |||	    For Sample Item class SPSounds, the player passes pointers
 |||	    to the Sample Item's sound data in memory the SoundSpooler rather than
 |||	    copying the sound data to the SPPlayer's buffers. That means that the
 |||	    sound data must remaing valid until the SoundSpooler has completely
 |||	    played the sound data, which happens some amount of time after the SPPlayer
 |||	    is done 'reading' that data.
 |||
 |||	    If you remove a Sample Item class SPSound during that window of vulnerability
 |||	    and then delete the data for the Sample Item (e.g. UnloadSample()),
 |||	    the SoundSpooler is then pointing to freed memory, whose contents
 |||	    may be clobbered by another task at any time. Unfortunately
 |||	    you may not hear bad results if you do this inadvertently because
 |||	    there's no guarantee that freed memory _will_ get trashed (unless you
 |||	    are using memdebug).
 |||
 |||	    So, avoid removing Sample Item class SPSounds while the SPPlayer is playing.
 |||	    Or at least go to measures to insure that the Sample Item class SPSound you
 |||	    are removing is not in the spooler (e.g. it has never been played, or at least
 |||	    not since the last spStop()).

 /**

 |||	  Synopsis
 |||
 |||	    Err spStartReading (SPSound *startSound,
 |||	                        const char *startMarkerName)
 |||
 |||	  Description
 |||
 |||	    This function begins the process of spooling data for an SPPlayer,
 |||	    processing marker actions along the way. It completely fills the
 |||	    spooler buffers belonging to the SPPlayer in preparation for playback,
 |||	    which can take an unpredictable amount of time. Therefore, the actual
 |||	    function to begin playback, spStartPlaying(), is a separate call so
 |||	    that starting the actual sound playback may be synchronized to some
 |||	    user event.
 |||
 |||	    Normally this function is called while the player's SP_STATUS_F_READING
 |||	    status flag is cleared (see spGetPlayerStatus()), in which case it merely
 |||	    begins reading at the specified location. The SP_STATUS_F_READING flag is
 |||	    then set. If the entire sound data to be played fits completely into the
 |||	    buffers, this flag is cleared again before this function returns.
 |||
 |||	    This function can also be called while the SP_STATUS_F_READING flag is set in
 |||	    order to force the playback to a different location without waiting for
 |||	    a marker branch or decision function. This abnormal method of
 |||	    relocating sound playback will almost certainly produce unpleasant
 |||	    sound output, but there may be times when it is necessary. Note that
 |||	    this merely causes reading to begin at a new location. It does not
 |||	    does not flush the spooler. Anything buffered already will continue
 |||	    play.
 |||
 |||	  Arguments
 |||
 |||	    startSound
 |||	        Pointer to SPSound to start reading from.
 |||
 |||	    startMarkerName
 |||	        Name of marker in startSound to start reading from.

 |||
 |||	    Non-negative value on success; negative error code on failure.
 |||

 |||	        spStartReading (player, sound1, SP_MARKER_NAME_BEGIN);

 |||
 |||	    Begins the actual output of spooled sound. This function begins
 |||	    playback immediately making it suitable for being called in
 |||	    sync with some user activity if necessary. spStartReading() prefills
 |||	    the spooler buffers. This function should therefore be called some time
 |||	    after calling spStartReading().
 |||
 |||	    Calling this function starts the process of signals arriving which
 |||	    need to be serviced with spService(). This function causes the
 |||	    SP_STATUS_F_PLAYING flag to be set.
 |||
 |||	    Call spStop() to manually stop or wait for playback to finish by
 |||	    checking spGetPlayerStatus() after calling spService().
 |||
 |||	  Arguments
 |||
 |||	    player
 |||	        Pointer to SPPlayer to start playing.
 |||
 |||	    startTagList
 |||	        Tag list be passed to StartInstrument() for sample player instrument.
 |||	        Useful tags include AF_TAG_AMPLITUDE_FP and AF_TAG_SAMPLE_RATE_FP. See
 |||	        StartInstrument() for details.
 |||
 |||	  Return Value
 |||
 |||	    Non-negative value on success; negative error code on failure.
 |||
 |||	  Notes
 |||
 |||	    The only bad thing that will happen if you call this function before calling
 |||	    spStartReading() is that you won't have any control over the
 |||	    precise time that playback begins. In that case, playback would start
 |||	    as soon as spStartReading() has read a buffer's worth of data. The player also
 |||	    might starved briefly if the 2nd buffer weren't ready before the first one
 |||	    finished.
 |||
 |||	    Multiple calls to spStartPlaying() without an intervening stop of some
 |||	    kind (spStop() or marker causing a stop) cause stuttered sound output.
 |||
 |||	    A call to spStartPlaying() will supercede a previous call to spPause().

 |||
 |||	  Synopsis
 |||
 |||	    int32 spService (SPPlayer *player, int32 signals)
 |||
 |||	  Description
 |||
 |||	    This function does the following:
 |||
 |||	    - processes signals received by the client's sent by the SPPlayer.
 |||
 |||	    - reads and spools more sound data, processing marker actions along the way.
 |||
 |||	    This function synchronizes the SPPlayer's SoundSpooler to the state of
 |||	    the signals read from the last WaitSignal(). You must call it after
 |||	    waiting for SPPlayer's signals before calling any other sound player
 |||	    function for this SPPlayer (with the exception of spDeletePlayer(),
 |||	    which can tolerate the spooler being out of sync with the task's
 |||	    signals).
 |||
 |||	    This function can set or clear the SP_STATUS_F_BUFFER_ACTIVE flag, depending
 |||	    on buffer usage. It clears SP_STATUS_F_READING when there's no more sound data
 |||	    to read. This function may be called under any player state including
 |||	    when SP_STATUS_F_PLAYING is not set without any ill effects.
 |||
 |||	    This function must be called exactly once for each WaitSignal() on
 |||	    an SPPlayer's signals. It will almost certainly have dangerous results
 |||	    if fed incorrect signals (signals other than from the most recent
 |||	    WaitSignal(), or signals that it has already processed).
 |||
 |||	  Arguments
 |||
 |||	    player
 |||	        Pointer to SPPlayer to service.
 |||
 |||	    signals
 |||	        Signals last received to process. Ignores
 |||	        any signals that do not belong to this
 |||	        SPPlayer. Does nothing if none of the
 |||	        SPPlayer's signals are set.
 |||
 |||	  Return Value
 |||
 |||	    Non-negative player status flags (SP_STATUS_F_) on success;
 |||	    negative error code on failure.
 |||
 |||	  Implementation
 |||
 |||	    Library call implemented in libmusic.a V24.
 |||
 |||	  Examples
 |||
 |||	    // error checking omitted for brevity
 |||
 |||	    {
 |||	        const int32 playersigs = spGetPlayerSignalMask (player);
 |||
 |||	            // service player until it's done
 |||	        while (spGetPlayerStatus(player) & SP_STATUS_F_BUFFER_ACTIVE) {
 |||	            const int32 sigs = WaitSignal (playersigs |
 |||	                                           othersignals1 |
 |||	                                           othersignals2);
 |||
 |||	                // service player before servicing other
 |||	                // things that might affect the player
 |||	            spService (player, playersigs);

 |||	    }
 |||
 |||	  Caveats
 |||
 |||	    Because spService() and spStartReading() wait for file I/O to complete, it is
 |||	    recommended that you use a separate, dedicated thread for each SPPlayer.

 |||

 |||	  Arguments

 |||	    player
 |||	        Pointer to SPPlayer to interrogate.
 |||
 |||	  Return Value
 |||
 |||	    Any combination of the following SP_STATUS_F_ flags (always a non-negative
 |||	    value):
 |||
 |||	    SP_STATUS_F_BUFFER_ACTIVE
 |||	        This flag indicates that there's something in the sound buffers waiting
 |||	        to be played. It is set or cleared by spStartReading(), spService(), and
 |||	        cleared by spStop().
 |||
 |||	        When this flag has been cleared after playback has started, all of the
 |||	        sound data has been played: it's safe to stop.
 |||
 |||	    SP_STATUS_F_READING
 |||	        This flag indicates that there's more data to read. It is set by
 |||	        spStartReading() and cleared when there is no more to read (by
 |||	        spStartReading() or spService()), or when spStop() is called.
 |||
 |||	    SP_STATUS_F_PLAYING
 |||	        This flag indicates that playback is underway. It is set by
 |||	        spStartPlaying() and cleared by spStop().
 |||
 |||	    SP_STATUS_F_PAUSED
 |||	        This flag indicates that player has been paused. It is set by spPause()
 |||	        and cleared by spResume(), spStop(), spStartPlaying(). This flag is
 |||	        really only meaningful when SP_STATUS_F_PLAYING is set.

 |||	    position is read by the player when any of the following is true:
 |||
 |||	    - there is a default decision function for the marker's SPPlayer.
 |||
 |||	    - the marker has a marker decision function.
 |||
 |||	    - the marker specifies a non-trivial action (branch or stop).
 |||
 |||	    - the marker is at the end of a sound.
 |||
 |||	    Normally, disc I/O is performed based on the size of each buffer. When
 |||	    one of the above conditions is true for a marker, the player will
 |||	    split up disc I/O at that marker in order to prepare for a possible
 |||	    branch. This impacts disc I/O efficiency. It is important to avoid
 |||	    having so many markers with non-trivial actions as to cripple the
 |||	    players ability to produce smooth sounding output. Since default
 |||	    decision functions affect every marker, it is necessary to insure
 |||	    that the marker spacing is such that smooth playback can still be
 |||	    produced. This is unfortunately one of those things that requires a
 |||	    bit of trial and error.
 |||
 |||	    The following steps are used in determining what action the SPPlayer
 |||	    will take when processing a marker's action:
 |||
 |||	    - If the marker has a decision function, call it. If the marker's decision
 |||	    function sets its resultAction (e.g. by a call to spSetBranchAction() or
 |||	    spSetStopAction()), then take that action.
 |||
 |||	    - Otherwise, if the there is a default decision function, call it. If the
 |||	    default decision function sets its resultAction (e.g. by a call to
 |||	    spSetBranchAction() or spSetStopAction()), then take that action.
 |||
 |||	    - Otherwise, if the marker specifies some static action (branch or stop),
 |||	    take that action.
 |||
 |||	    - Otherwise, if the marker is at the end of a sound, stop reading.
 |||
 |||	    - Otherwise continue reading the sound after the marker.
 |||
 |||	    A decision function MAY do almost anything to the SPPlayer that owns
 |||	    this marker including adding new sounds or markers, changing the
 |||	    static action for this or any other marker, changing the default or
 |||	    marker decision functions for this or any other marker, deleting this
 |||	    or any other marker or sound (with the below caveats in mind).
 |||
 |||	    A decision functoin MUST NOT do any of the following:
 |||
 |||	    - call any function that changes the player state (e.g., spDeletePlayer(),
 |||	    spStop(), spStartReading(), spStartPlaying(), spService(), etc) for the
 |||	    current SPMarker's SPPlayer.
 |||
 |||	    - delete the current SPMarker's SPSound since this has the side effect of
 |||	    calling spStop().
 |||
 |||	    - delete the current marker without setting up resultAction to stop or
 |||	    branch to another marker.
 |||
 |||	    - take a long time to execute.
 |||
 |||	  Arguments
 |||
 |||	    resultAction
 |||	        SPAction to optionally be filled out
 |||	        by decision function. If it isn't filled
 |||	        out, the sound player ignores the call
 |||	        to the decision function and continues
 |||	        as if the decision function hadn't been
 |||	        installed.
 |||
 |||	    decisionData
 |||	        Pointer to client data passed to
 |||	        spSetMarkerDecisionFunction() or
 |||	        spSetDefaultDecisionFunction().
 |||
 |||	    sound
 |||	        Pointer to SPSound containing marker for which the player
 |||	        is requesting a playback decision.
 |||
 |||	    markerName
 |||	        Name of marker for which the player
 |||	        is requesting a playback decision.
 |||
 |||	  Return Value
 |||
 |||	    Client should return a non-negative value for success, or a negative error code on failure.
 |||	    An error code returned to the sound player causes the sound player to stop reading
 |||	    and return that error code back to the caller.
 |||
 |||	  Outputs
 |||
 |||	    Decision function can set the SPAction by calling one of the following:
 |||
 |||	    spSetBranchAction()
 |||	        Specifies a marker to branch to as the result of this decision function.
 |||
 |||	    spSetStopAction()
 |||	        Specifies that reader should stop as the result of this decision
 |||	        function.
 |||
 |||	    If the decision does note set the SPAction, the sound player ignores the
 |||	    the decision function (acts as if decision function hadn't been installed).
 |||
 |||	  Examples
 |||
 |||	    Err mydecision (SPAction *resultAction, int32 *remaining,
 |||	                    SPSound *sound, const char *markerName)
 |||	    {
 |||	            // stop when remaining count reaches zero
 |||	        if ((*remaining)-- <= 0) {
 |||	            return spSetStopAction (resultAction);
 |||	        }
 |||
 |||	            // do nothing (take default action) otherwise
 |||	        return 0;
