When you run; this patch with dspfaders, you'll notice phasing between the filter and; pitch sweeps (both set in the source below to 3.0 Hz). You won't be able; to adjust the FiltRate slider to compensate exactly, because the filter; sweep uses the sawtooth.dsp instrument, whose Frequency knob doesn't; have sufficiently fine precision to be hit 3.0 Hz exaclty. The precision; is approximately 0.673 Hz; the nearest multiples of this to 3.0 are; 2.692 Hz and 3.365 Hz. An LFO's frequency precision is 256 times as fine; as that of an audio frequency oscillator (approx 0.00263 Hz), so; triangle_lfo.dsp's Frequency knob can be set almost exactly to 3.0 Hz; (either 2.999 Hz or 3.002 Hz); You can get all sorts of interesting things out of this patch by setting; the frequency knob to a little negative value (say, -4.0).    ; oscillatorInstrument osc impulse.dspInstrument tri triangle_lfo.dspInstrument saw sawtooth.dspInstrument svf svfilter.dspInstrument mod1 timesplus.dspInstrument mod2 timesplus.dspOutput Output 1 SignedConstant svf Resonance 0 0.1; Control pathConnect saw     Output  0       mod1    InputA          0Connect mod1    Output  0       svf     Frequency       0 ; modulation destinationConnect tri     Output  0       mod2    InputA          0Connect mod2    Output  0       osc     Frequency       0 ; modulation destination; Signal pathConnect osc     Output  0       svf     Input           0Connect svf     Output  0       .
