This results in the frequency of the audio output; being swept up and down at a rate determined by the frequency of the; low frequency oscillator.; First, define some instrumentsInstrument lfo triangle_lfo.dsp;       Note the use of triangle_lfo.dsp to increase the resolution of the;       modulation frequency.Instrument osc pulse.dspInstrument mod timesplus.dsp; The "timesplus" dsp object serves to scale (change the gain of) and shift the; modulating frequency, so by changing the value of the "B" input (the; multiply, or gain, amount) you can control the depth of the modulation; and by changing the "C" input you can control the center frequency; around which the modulation occurs.; Next, define the knobs used to vary parameters, and the patch outputKnob  ModRate 1 LFOFreq 2.0     ; modulation rate, default to 2HzKnob  ModDepth 1 OscFreq 20.0   ; modulation depth, default to +/- 20HzKnob  Frequency 1 OscFreq 440.0 ; frequency offset, default to A4Knob  Amplitude 1 Signed 0.8    ; amplitude of outputOutput Output 1 Signed; Next, define the path lfo->scaling unit->oscillator->outputConnect lfo Output 0 mod InputA 0Connect mod Output 0 osc Frequency 0 ; modulation destinationConnect osc Output 0 .
